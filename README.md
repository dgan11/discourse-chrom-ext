- **Content Script** (`content.js`)
  - Detects Discourse forums and posts
  - Extracts post content and related topics
  - Processes and cleans HTML content
  - Injects UI components into the page

- **Background Service** (`background.js`)
  - Handles data fetching and caching
  - Manages extension state
  - Communicates between components

- **Utilities** (`utils/`)
  - `fetchPosts.js`: Handles Discourse API interactions
  - More utilities to come for summarization and UI
